already some preprocessing done; something to keep in mind
  something to keep in mind
shift, but there is some overlap
  but that overlap happens by definition
  depending on where you are in supersymmetric space, the overlap can be really bad
significance: #(signal)/sqrt(#background)

something to do:
  do cut and count and see if the line is to the right of the point (mva_bdt_rejBvsS;1)

separation looks too nice for training data

only using 1/20th of the dat
experimetn:
  progressively double the size of your data set
  100, 200, 400, 800, ....
  see what the trend is in terms of overtraining

the more points you have, the more attuned you are to those specific data points
change balance between train and test
  current config: 50% training/50% test
  another possible config: 80% training/20% on test 

todo:
  1000 data points and 10000 data points
  stick with 50/50
  run PCA and get two most important components
  email plot to devika
  color points so background and signal are distinguished

todo:
  number of trees should be about sqrt of points

show on same plot:
  where are humans at this?
  and how well is bdt doing
  this approach is very similar to medical decision making

suggested future work:
  change bdt computations
  not worried about confusion matrix

plot significance vs. number of trees
normalize all variables?
  look into documentation and c++ code to see if the normalization is already being done
