//correct energy to 8 TeV
generate from gg => stop stop at 8 TeV
see if I can invoke jet-finding algorithms and find jets
learn boosted decision trees
general background in machine learning

neutralino: lighest supersymmetric partner (chi tilde)
renormalization is like telescoping series cancelling
supersymmetry is more of term-by-term cancellation
fine-tuning problem

		save # jets and their energies to a file
		use root to plot them up (root = data visualization and analysis)
		start to create variables in phenomenological paper
	week from now: guy from a&m
		data files
	write the proposal and send to Padley
	crackpot index


Root:
	explore decision trees
	will adapt to real analysis, but doesn't have diagnostics of WECA	
WECA:
	Java, machine-learning techniques

PT = sqrt(px^2+py^2); beam in z direction

There are 6 jets in the all-hadronic channel: 2 b-tagged, 4 untagged
This is because:
t => b + W
W => jj
so t => bjj

To separate the signal into two systems:
	bjj combination with largest PT
	bjj ccombination with 2nd largest PT
	calculate M3 for both
	calculate M2 for both
	Combined chi-squared test: M3 => t, M2 => W
	Choose better combination and assign to top quark A
Rest of hte system is top quark B


October 23, 2012:
	ROOT Plots of M3 of top quark A across multiple events
	ROOT Plots of M2 of top quark A across multiple events
	ROOT Plots of M3 of top quark B across multiple events
	ROOT Plots of M2 of top quark B across multiple events

	for both SUSY and tt-jet events
	with the stipulation that: need to record at least two definite b tags; otherwise, discard the event



October 30, 2012:
	for system B, take only bottom + 2 best jets
	do plots for multiple susy files
	plots for Angular and MT Cuts
