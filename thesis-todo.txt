		save # jets and their energies to a file
		use root to plot them up (root = data visualization and analysis)
		start to create variables in phenomenological paper
	week from now: guy from a&m
		data files
	write the proposal and send to Padley
	crackpot index


Root:
	explore decision trees
	will adapt to real analysis, but doesn't have diagnostics of WECA	
WECA:
	Java, machine-learning techniques

PT = sqrt(px^2+py^2); beam in z direction

There are 6 jets in the all-hadronic channel: 2 b-tagged, 4 untagged
This is because:
t => b + W
W => jj
so t => bjj

To separate the signal into two systems:
	bjj combination with largest PT
	bjj ccombination with 2nd largest PT
	calculate M3 for both
	calculate M2 for both
	Combined chi-squared test: M3 => t, M2 => W
	Choose better combination and assign to top quark A
Rest of hte system is top quark B


October 23, 2012:
	ROOT Plots of M3 of top quark A across multiple events
	ROOT Plots of M2 of top quark A across multiple events
	ROOT Plots of M3 of top quark B across multiple events
	ROOT Plots of M2 of top quark B across multiple events

	for both SUSY and tt-jet events
	with the stipulation that: need to record at least two definite b tags; otherwise, discard the event



October 30, 2012:
	for system B, take only bottom + 2 best jets
	do plots for multiple susy files
	plots for Angular and MT Cuts

November 6, 2012:
	Delta phi between b_B and missing transverse energy =
		x-y angle between momentum of bottom quark and momentum corresponding to missing transverse energy
		how to calculate the latter?
			sum up transverse momentum components of ALL events in the collision
			theoretically should be 0, but it won't be.
			take the negative of that (for missing); that's your missing trasverse momentum vector

	Transverse mass is defined on wikipedia
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_mass

	david scott, prof of statistics, wrote the book on kernel density estimation


November 20, 2012:
	Label which susy point used
	angle plots for multiple susy points
	Throw everything into a BDT
	Email Kuver with question about whether different files correspond to different data points
		Padley: could be different Monte Carlo simulations of the same susy point

January 28, 2013:
	Add to bdt:
		missing E_T 
		azimuthal angles
	Take a closer look at the individual decision trees
	Make sure same number of A and B events
	Write up outline in Powerpoint
	Post code on github
